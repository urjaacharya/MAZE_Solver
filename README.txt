Introduction
- This program finds shortest path from the location chosen by the user to the nearest exit of the maze using BFS. 
- exits are white spaces located at the boundaries of the maze.
- The black block are obstacle to be avoided during path generation.
- If user’s selected location is a black block, it displays information that the selected position is an obstacle and does not generate any path.
- on every user click, new path from latest location to its nearest exit is generated.
 
Steps to run:
- Run the python file “solve_MAZE_python.py”
- Enter the filename of the maze and press enter.
- The maze file should a text file where the first line gives dimension of the maze and is followed by the values of the maze. An example maze file named “example_maze.txt” is provided in the repository.
